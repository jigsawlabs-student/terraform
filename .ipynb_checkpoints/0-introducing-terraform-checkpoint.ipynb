This is our web interface for using AWS, where we relied on a combination of dashboards and forms, to get our AWS resources properly configured as part of deploying our application.  In this lesson, we'll see how set up our AWS resources purely through code, by using a new tool called terraform. "

It's also easier to get an overview of our infrastrcuture, as the state of our infrastructure is in code, and we do not have to navigate through various dashboards.  It becomes easier to reproduce our infrastructure -- say in a different AWS region, simply by reusing the code.  We can also use coding practices like variables to ensure that we do not repeat ourselves, and our values (like port numbers) are consistent.  \n",
